# LazyTracker

LazyTracker is a lossless capture tool that turns messy, on-the-go expense notes into usable outputs later.

LazyTracker is a lightweight capture-and-preview tool for people on the move.  
You type or dictate expenses freely, check how the system interprets them, make quick corrections, and save everything without losing the original input.

---

**LazyTracker is designed for low-energy moments.**  
It does not require structure at entry time.  
Raw input is always preserved; interpretation is reversible.
